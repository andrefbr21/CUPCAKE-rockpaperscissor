# CUPCAKE-rockpaperscissors
Challenge from CupCake Games


Instructions:
Run the .swf if you have flash player installed on your machine, or else you can run the .html file and use the flash player of your browser instead.

I have also made a little bonus, i have ported the game to android and there is a .APK file to install on your android device.
IOS version comming soon TM (just kidding apple dont allow device tests as easy.)

Also there's a enable spock/lisard button, the original price is 0.99$ but for you guys it's free. (just for now! ;))
The code was so extensible / generic using polymorphism poo that i have made this mode in under 5 minutes.

Hope you guys like it, i was very exited by this test, Thank you very much!
I did this in under one sitting, about 5 hours of work.
